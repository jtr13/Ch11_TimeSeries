We use the [**quantmod**](https://www.quantmod.com/) package to get stock prices from Q3 2015 to the present, for four stocks--Alaska Air (ALK), JetBlue Airways (JBLU), Spirit Airlines (SAVE), and Hawaiian Holdings (HA)--discussed in this article: ["4 Top Airline Stocks to Buy Now"](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/11/08/4-top-airline-stocks-to-buy-now.aspx).

```{r}
# stock symbols 
stocks <- c("ALK", "JBLU", "SAVE", "HA")

# get multiple stocks
df <- tidyquant::tq_get(stocks, from = "2015-10-01")

df2 <- df %>% group_by(symbol) %>% mutate(close = 100*close/close[1]) %>% ungroup()


ggplot(df2, aes(x = date, y = close, color = symbol)) + 
  geom_line()
       
```
